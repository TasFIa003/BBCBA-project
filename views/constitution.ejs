             Bioinformatics is a new discipline which combined statistics, computer technology and molecular biology etc. Recently it revolutionized the modern life science research. Bioinformatics play the key role to modernize biotechnology. The vast amount of data generated by human, plant (e.g. jute genome project of Bangladesh) and other genome research project by genome sequencing would be unmanageable without bioinformatics tools. Application of bioinformatics drastically reduces the cost of these projects.  Bioinformatics is very useful to understand the gene and genome functionality. It is also used to quicken the discovery of new varieties of crops, new drugs, and design of novel vaccine and development of new antimicrobial/anticancer drugs. Rapid modernization of biotechnology seems to be impossible without bioinformatics. New bioinformatics tools are developed everyday holding new promise for the improvement of agriculture and health research. Many bioinformatics society exists in developed countries. Researchers keep connected each other as well as develop collaborating research groups in their field through the society. In country, many researchers of different universities and institutes are working on bioinformatics fields individually. As this field is going to mature in developed countries, many Bangladeshi students on abroad are doing research on bioinformatics. When they come back to country they may be not get collaborators, as a result they may be  not run their research properly. Thus formation of a national bioinformatics forum including the researchers/students from related discipline (biomedical science, statistics, computer science and engineering agricultural sciences, veterinary sciences, etc.) is today’s demand for knowledge sharing among countries’ researchers. Thus, <b>Bangladesh  Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Association (BBCBA)</b> have been formed under the following constitution.
